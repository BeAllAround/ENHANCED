# ENHANCED - experimental!

The ENHANCED library is an API set up of some of the modern methods written in C++. Such methods are built-in in JavaScript, Python and other high-level languages. By emulating the functions, you're letting the complexity of a project decrease significantly.

The purpose of writting it is to make life easier for C++ developers who prefer back-end toolsets to be written stricly in C++. For the simple reason that we could extend them and analyse the complexity.

Still in development! splitFunction is available as a tryOut and it runs properly, so you can use it in your own projects.
