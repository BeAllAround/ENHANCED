# Emulator - experimental!

The Emulator library is supposed to consist of all modern libraries written in C++. Such libraries are built-in in JavaScript, Python and other high-level languages. 
The purpose of writting it is to make life easier for C++ developers who prefer back-end toolsets to be written stricly in C++. For the simple reason that we could extend them and analyse the complexity.

Still in development! splitFunction is available as a tryOut and it runs properly, so you can use it in your own projects.
